This is a sample data science project for Teachers Pay Teachers.

It uses a Kaggle dataset on bike sharing demand, found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand.

There are two files, one for data exploration and analysis, and the other for regression.

In the first, the data is transformed with maps, and some new fields are created by bucketizing continuous features. Many dataframes and plots are then created to see how the number of bikes rented correlate to each of the fields.

In the second, the data is transformed with one hot encoding, to ensure the categorical variables can be used with a linear model. Then a simple linear regression model is created and evaluated.
